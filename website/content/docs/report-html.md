In this report, you'll find a violations table, telling you which automated checks failed and why; and a series of sections containing extracted data, such as a headings outline and list of images, to highlight potential problem areas and to assist in manual checking.

This report includes:

* Basic information about the book (`Metadata details`)
* A list of violations, organized into a  (`Violations`)
* A summary of the publication's TOC
* An outline view of all the headings in the publication, arranged in reading order. Any skipped levels (i.e. going from H1 to H3 with no H2 in between) are flagged as `Missing heading`.
* An outline view for each HTML file in the publication
* A summary of accessibility metadata, including what's missing
* A list of images and associated descriptions, organized into a table

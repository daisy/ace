Ace, the Accessibility Checker for EPUB, is a tool developed by the [DAISY Consortium](http://daisy.org) to assist with the evaluation of accessibility features of EPUB publications.

Read more about the Ace project on [Inclusive Publishing](http://inclusivepublishing.org/ace).

Latest version: v1.0.2.

Note: We’re working on a simple GUI with an installer, to allow using Ace without having to deal with package managers and command line tools… stay tuned!

      <description>In addition to the HTML rules, Ace has a set of rules that are EPUB-specific:
   Rule Description     epub-pagesource Ensures that if the content has page breaks, the print source is identified in the Package Document metadata with dc:source.   epub-title Ensures that the EPUBâ€™s title is defined in the Package Document.   epub-type-has-matching-role Ensures that the element has an ARIA role matching its epub:type.</description>

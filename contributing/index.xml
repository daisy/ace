      <description>HTML checker Under the hood, most of the HTML checks are powered by axe, an engine for automated testing of HTML from Deque Systems.
Headless browser During the evaluation of an EPUB, Ace loads each HTML content document in a &amp;ldquo;headless&amp;rdquo; web browser window (i.e. invisible from the point of view of the user of the command line tool, but nonetheless using a real rendering engine). Ace was originally based on Puppeteer but it is now using Electron by default.</description>
